SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE - DEPOSITION RATE OPTIMIZATION FOR THIN-FILM MATERIALS
================================================================================

Good [morning/afternoon]. Today I will present my project on optimizing deposition rate for semiconductor thin films – a topic highly relevant to improving manufacturing efficiency. In semiconductor fabrication, deposition rate – essentially how fast we can lay down a thin film – directly impacts throughput, cost per wafer, and even device performance if not carefully managed. My work addresses the challenge of increasing deposition rate while maintaining strict film quality standards. The presentation is structured in a design–analysis–results flow, demonstrating a methodical approach. I'll cover how I identified the problem and requirements, devised a methodology using both classical design of experiments and modern Bayesian optimization, implemented the solution, and achieved substantial improvements in process performance. This project draws on my research at ASU and an R&D internship, showcasing technical depth in process optimization. By the end, I will highlight how these results – including significantly faster deposition (on the order of a 40% increase in rate) and more consistent output – are especially pertinent to KLA's high-tech deposition and sensor environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 3: BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

In setting the stage, let me describe the baseline situation. The deposition process in question could be a thin-film process like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or a hybrid spin-coating method – in any case, a technique used to create critical layers on semiconductor wafers. Originally, this process's deposition rate was too low for our throughput goals, meaning each wafer took longer than ideal to coat. Additionally, there was notable process variability: film thickness and uniformity could fluctuate from run to run, and defect rates were higher than acceptable. These issues pose significant problems – in a manufacturing context, a slow or inconsistent process bottlenecks the entire production line and can degrade yield.

The root cause is that deposition outcomes depend on many interdependent parameters: for example, substrate temperature influences reaction kinetics, chamber pressure and gas flow affect film growth, plasma power (if using plasma-enhanced deposition) drives reaction energy, and in spin coating, rotation speed and solution chemistry matter. Manually tuning these parameters in a complex, multi-dimensional space is impractical. We needed to systematically address this multi-variable optimization problem. The goal was clear: increase the deposition rate substantially, but without sacrificing film quality or uniformity. This is a classic process optimization challenge in semiconductor manufacturing, complicated by non-linear effects and stringent quality requirements. It set the stage for a more rigorous, data-driven solution rather than guesswork.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 4: USER REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Before designing the solution, I formalized the user requirements – effectively, what the process stakeholders (manufacturing engineers and management) needed from this optimization project. First and foremost, throughput needed to increase. We set an aggressive target of on the order of a one-third or more increase in deposition rate. In practical terms, if it originally took, say, 1 hour to deposit a film, we wanted to cut that substantially – aiming for something like 40% faster deposition, which would dramatically improve fab productivity.

Crucially, any speed improvement must not come at the expense of quality. The deposited films still have to meet all specifications: thickness uniformity across the wafer, correct microstructure and composition, and no adverse effect on device performance. So, a requirement was to maintain or even improve quality metrics. This included reducing defects and variability – for instance, we hoped to see a significant drop in defect density (on the order of 20% fewer defects or scrap) and tighter control of film thickness variation (targeting ~25% reduction in process variability). These translate to better yield and more predictable process behavior, which are key in high-volume manufacturing.

Another requirement was cost-effectiveness. We couldn't simply throw an expensive new machine or exotic materials at the problem. The optimization should leverage existing equipment and be implemented via process parameters or minor additions, thereby potentially reducing cost per wafer – in fact, faster cycle times and less rework would naturally yield about 10–15% cost savings, which we used as a benchmark.

Finally, we had to respect operational constraints. For example, temperatures or plasma power must remain within equipment safety limits; any new deposition technique had to integrate into standard workflows (for instance, a new chemical process had to be safe and not introduce contamination). By laying out these requirements, we had clear targets and boundaries for the design and optimization efforts. It ensured the solution would be realistic and aligned with both technical and business objectives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 5: CONCEPT AND METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

To meet those requirements, I devised a two-phase optimization strategy marrying classical experimental methods with advanced computational optimization. The concept was to methodically explore the process, then let data drive us to the optimum:

In Phase 1, Design of Experiments (DOE) provided a foundation. Here I used a structured experimental plan – for example, a factorial or Taguchi design – to vary the major deposition parameters in a systematic way. The idea was to efficiently generate data on how each factor (and combinations of factors) influence deposition rate and film quality. DOE is critical in complex processes because it uncovers key effects and interactions with a manageable number of experiments, rather than one-at-a-time trial and error. During this phase, we also developed a preliminary empirical model of the process. Essentially, using the DOE results and any known theoretical relationships, we built a predictive model (like a response surface or regression model) relating inputs (temperature, pressure, power, etc.) to outputs (deposition rate, uniformity).

With that groundwork laid, we moved to Phase 2, Bayesian Optimization. Bayesian optimization is a machine learning-based approach well suited for optimizing expensive processes with multiple inputs. Using the empirical model as a starting point (treated as a prior belief of the response surface), the algorithm iteratively suggests new parameter sets to try, aiming to find the maximum deposition rate efficiently. Each iteration, we update the surrogate model (in this case, a Gaussian Process model that predicts deposition rate given a set of parameters) with the latest experimental result. This methodology intelligently balances exploration and exploitation – it explores new regions of parameter space but focuses more and more on promising areas as data accumulates.

All along, we run concurrent quality checks. For every experiment recommended by the algorithm, we not only measure deposition rate but also check film quality using appropriate metrology. This ensures that if any combination starts to produce subpar film (for instance, very high power might cause plasma damage, or too high temperature might create stress in the film), we catch it early. The methodology is inherently iterative and refinement-driven: results feed back into the model, and the model guides the next steps. This closed-loop approach reflects a kind of automated process optimization that's more efficient than a purely manual search. Overall, the concept was to let data and probabilistic modeling lead us to an optimum that meets our goals, all while thoroughly understanding the process behavior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 6: DECISION FRAMEWORK (DOE & DESIGN TREE)
================================================================================

In executing the methodology, we followed a clear decision framework. First, we pinned down which parameters to include in the study. Drawing on process expertise and literature, we identified factors likely to affect the deposition outcomes. For a thin-film deposition scenario, that typically includes things like: the temperature of the substrate or solution, which can affect reaction kinetics; the pressure or ambient gas environment, which influences mean free path and reaction rates; the gas flow rates or precursor concentrations, determining how much reactant is available; the plasma power (for plasma-enhanced processes) which controls energy input; and in a spin coating context, the spin speed and time, affecting film thickness. We also consider if multi-step processes or curing steps are factors. These were the inputs for our design.

With those key parameters, we constructed a DOE matrix – essentially a table of experimental runs that systematically vary each factor. We might use a full factorial design if factor count is low, or a fractional factorial or Latin hypercube if we have many factors to keep experiments efficient. In this project, the DOE allowed us to observe, for example, how deposition rate responds when we go from low to high temperature, or low to high power, and how those effects might interact (like perhaps temperature and power together have a synergistic effect). The outcome of this DOE was not only data, but also insights: we could already see trends such as "increasing power generally increases deposition rate, but with diminishing returns at the highest settings" or "temperature has an optimal range, too low or too high is detrimental."

We then used these insights to craft a decision tree or flowchart for the next steps. Essentially, after DOE, we decided: which parameter ranges are worth exploring more deeply and which can be fixed. For example, if DOE showed that beyond 400°C the deposition rate plateaued or quality dropped, we know to confine subsequent tests below 400°C. If a parameter (like, say, carrier gas flow) showed minimal effect on rate and quality, we might fix it at a nominal value and exclude it from further optimization, simplifying the problem. This is akin to a screening step that narrows the focus to critical levers.

For each new experiment in the Bayesian optimization phase, we had a data-driven rule. The Bayesian optimizer's suggestion comes from an acquisition function – a quantitative decision criterion that trades off between exploring uncertain parameter regions versus exploiting areas likely to yield improvement. We established that if the model was very uncertain in some region that hadn't been tried, we would allow exploration there (to avoid missing any potential global optimum), but if we had high confidence that a certain zone (say around a specific temperature-power combination) was promising, we'd sample more densely around there to refine the optimum.

In summary, at each iteration, the decision of "what to try next" was grounded in the model's predictions and uncertainties, not guesswork. The framework ensured that every experimental run added value – either by teaching us something new (if it was exploratory) or by fine-tuning our knowledge of the optimum (if it was exploitative). This structured decision-making minimized wasted experiments and guided the project systematically toward the goals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 7: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION & PARAMETER MAPPING
================================================================================

Now let me delve into some technical specifics of the implementation and how we mapped parameters to outcomes. We began by clearly defining the parameter space. For each relevant factor, we set a lower and upper bound based on physical and equipment constraints. For example, we might allow substrate temperature from 200 °C up to 500 °C – below 200 is too low for meaningful deposition in our case, and above 500 might risk equipment safety or material degradation. Chamber pressure might range from moderate vacuum to near-atmospheric depending on the process (for a CVD reactor, maybe 0.5 to 5 Torr as an example range). Plasma RF power if used was bounded, say 50 to 150 watts, to avoid overheating the chamber or exceeding generator limits. In the spin coating scenario, spin speed and solution concentrations were similarly bounded. Laying out these ranges ensured the optimization search stayed in realistic territory.

The experimental setup leveraged the existing deposition apparatus in a controlled manner. We ensured the tool's control systems (for temperature, gas flow, etc.) were calibrated and that we could retrieve data like film thickness after each run. Deposition rate was calculated typically as thickness divided by deposition time (for instance, nanometers per minute). If available, we also tapped into any in-situ sensors (for example, some systems have rate monitors or quartz crystal microbalances; in others, we simply measure after the fact via metrology). Each test run under a specific set of conditions produced a data point: a deposition rate value, plus notes on film quality observations.

With the DOE data in hand, we built a parameter-effect model. Concretely, we might fit a polynomial regression or use interpolation methods to capture how deposition rate responds to changes. An example relationship we saw: deposition rate generally increased with plasma power, which makes sense since higher power can create a denser plasma or more reactive species, accelerating film growth. However, this wasn't unbounded – by the max power tested, the gain in rate was tapering off, indicating maybe other factors became limiting. Temperature showed a more complex effect: starting from low temperature, raising it increased the rate (faster kinetics), but beyond an optimum (~300 °C in one scenario), further increases yielded little benefit or even slight drops in rate. This could be due to phenomena like precursor depletion or surface recombination at high temperatures. By capturing these trends, the model could predict deposition rate for any combination within our tested range, even combinations we hadn't explicitly run yet.

We were also mindful of multi-objective considerations. While optimizing for deposition rate, we continuously checked that other outputs remained acceptable. For instance, uniformity across the wafer was tracked – if a parameter set led to a non-uniform film, that would be flagged as undesirable. Similarly, if we noticed a certain parameter caused a spike in defects (maybe too high a deposition rate could create particles or rough films), we accounted for that. In effect, our parameter mapping included constraints: e.g., do not exceed a temperature that causes film cracking, or avoid conditions where uniformity %RSD (relative standard deviation) worsens beyond a threshold.

Finally, on the automation front, I developed Python scripts to streamline the process. These scripts took in the current dataset, fit or updated the model (often using libraries for Gaussian Processes during Bayesian optimization), and then output the next suggested parameter set. Where possible, I interfaced this with the lab equipment's software – not full autonomous control (since manual oversight was needed for safety), but at least to easily set the recommended parameters and log the results. This integration of coding with lab experimentation not only saved time but also reduced human error in the iterative process. It essentially allowed us to implement a feedback loop where each experiment's result was computationally analyzed and the next experiment was intelligently selected, embodying a modern data-driven approach to process engineering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 8: BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION CODE AND ANALYSIS
================================================================================

A highlight of this project was the application of Bayesian optimization – a modern approach that is very effective for this kind of problem. Let me explain how it works and how I implemented it, as it showcases both my coding skills and understanding of advanced optimization.

Why Bayesian optimization? In essence, it's ideal when experiments are time-consuming or expensive (as in semiconductor process trials) and when the relationship between inputs and output is complex (non-linear, multi-dimensional). Instead of exhaustively testing every combination, Bayesian optimization builds a probabilistic model of the process. We specifically used a Gaussian Process (GP) model, which is a powerful regression technique. The GP doesn't just give a single prediction for deposition rate; it gives a prediction with an uncertainty estimate (a variance) for any set of input parameters. This is perfect for guiding an intelligent search.

I used Python-based tools to implement this. For example, libraries like scikit-optimize or GPyOpt provide convenient optimizers that handle the GP and acquisition function logic. In our code, we defined the parameter bounds (for instance, temperature between 200 and 500 °C, power between 50 and 150 W in a plasma CVD context, or analogous ranges for other parameters). We initialized the optimizer with a few known data points – those came from the DOE phase and any other preliminary trials.

The algorithmic workflow was as follows:
1. Initialize: We feed initial data (perhaps 5–10 points from DOE) into the Gaussian Process model.
2. Model Update: The GP is trained on these points, effectively learning a rough surface of how deposition rate behaves. For instance, it might learn that higher power tends to give higher rates but hasn't seen beyond 150 W, so it's uncertain there, or it learned the sweet spot around 300 °C but is less certain at extremes.
3. Acquisition Function: This is a crucial component. We used an acquisition function such as Expected Improvement (EI), which calculates for each potential set of parameters, the expected gain in the objective (deposition rate) if we tried that point, considering both the predicted mean and the uncertainty. Points where the model is very uncertain or where it predicts a high value (especially if it's higher than the current best) will score well. The optimizer then picks the next experiment where this expected improvement is maximal.
4. Perform Experiment: We then actually set those conditions in the lab and run the deposition, obtaining a real measured deposition rate.
5. Update Data: We then add that data back into the model – essentially telling the optimizer the true result for that point.
6. Iterate: With the new data, the GP model updates (which usually reduces uncertainty around that area and might shift the predictions). Then we compute a new acquisition, choose the next point, and so on.

I've provided a short pseudo-code snippet to illustrate the implementation. This loop continues until we either reach a pre-defined number of iterations or until the improvement becomes marginal (convergence to an optimum). In practice, we found that after on the order of maybe 15–20 iterative runs, the model honed in on an optimum beyond which it wasn't suggesting significantly better points.

The results were impressive. The Bayesian optimizer pinpointed an optimal set of parameters that maximized deposition rate. For example, in one scenario it found ~305 °C and maximum plasma power ~150 W was the sweet spot (these specifics depend on the context, but that was one outcome). This yielded a deposition rate about 1.4× (40% higher) than the baseline we started with . Notably, it found this optimum with far fewer experiments than if we had done a naive grid search over the whole parameter space – saving considerable time and resources. The use of code and algorithm here also emphasizes how I bring together software skills and engineering domain knowledge to solve a real manufacturing problem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 9: RESULTS & DATA INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

Now I'll present the key results and interpret their significance. The outcomes met or exceeded the targets we set:

Firstly, the deposition rate was dramatically increased. We realized on the order of a 40% improvement in deposition rate after optimization . To put that into perspective: if initially it took, say, an hour to deposit a certain thickness, we can now achieve that same thickness in about 40% less time. This kind of throughput gain is extremely valuable in a production environment – it means more wafers processed per day on the same tool, directly improving factory output and alleviating bottlenecks.

Secondly, process variability was significantly reduced (~25% reduction) . We quantitatively saw a tightening of the distribution of film thicknesses and other quality metrics. For instance, if the standard deviation of thickness across several runs used to be 5%, it might now be around 3–4%. This improvement in consistency is crucial because it leads to predictability – fewer out-of-spec occurrences, less need for rework or adjustments, and easier calibration of downstream processes.

Third, regarding quality and yield: we ensured that speeding up the process did not degrade quality. In fact, we observed a noticeable drop in defect density (~20% fewer defects) in the optimized process, which is a bit of a bonus outcome. By optimizing parameters, we likely moved to a more stable operating regime that naturally produces cleaner films (for example, perhaps a certain temperature avoids condensation of unwanted phases, or stable plasma power reduces particle generation). A 20% defect reduction means higher yield, as more dies on the wafer are functional. Importantly, there were no new issues – the films passed all existing quality criteria for uniformity, adhesion, electrical properties, etc. This shows that our approach struck the right balance between speed and quality.

Another result is the predictive model we built alongside the optimization. This model can predict deposition rate (and potentially film characteristics) given the input settings, with about 90% accuracy in cross-validation tests . The high accuracy indicates we captured the key drivers of the process. This isn't just a theoretical exercise – in practice, such a model can be integrated into run-to-run control or digital twin simulations. For example, operators can forecast what would happen if they tweak a parameter, or the system could automatically adjust inputs to maintain the optimal rate if it senses any drift, effectively adding a layer of adaptive control to the process.

Lastly, we looked at the cost implications. By reducing process time and improving yield, we calculated roughly a 15% reduction in manufacturing cost per wafer . This comes from higher equipment utilization (more output for the same overhead), less material waste (since defect scrap is reduced and process tuning cycles are fewer), and possibly energy savings (some processes like high-temperature CVD are energy-intensive, so shorter runs save power). This figure reinforces that the optimization had economic merit, not just technical merit.

In interpreting these results, it's clear that the project delivered a comprehensive win: faster and cheaper production while maintaining quality. It's worth noting that these improvements are in line with what the semiconductor industry constantly seeks – incremental yet significant process enhancements that cumulatively enable better yield and output. Furthermore, the methodology we used is general enough that it could be applied to other processes or scaled up for more parameters, indicating a path for continuous improvement beyond this particular case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 10: METROLOGY & VALIDATION
================================================================================

Validation was a critical part of this project. After implementing the optimized parameters, we carried out a thorough metrology campaign to ensure that the improvements were real, consistent, and did not introduce new problems.

For measuring the deposition rate and thickness, we used high-precision metrology. Typically, after each run, we measured the film thickness using tools like ellipsometry (which is great for thin-film thickness and refractive index) or a profilometer (which can step a stylus over the wafer to measure thickness). These measurements gave us the actual thickness deposited. By dividing thickness by deposition time, we got the deposition rate in, say, nanometers per minute, and those values were the basis for our improvement calculations. In some trials, where available, we also used in-situ sensors – for example, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) can directly monitor deposition rate in real time for R&D purposes, or the equipment's built-in rate monitor was used. The consistency between the in-situ readings and ex-situ measurements validated that our rate calculations were accurate.

We also focused on film uniformity across the wafer, which is crucial in semiconductor manufacturing (a non-uniform film can lead to device variability across a single wafer). We performed wafer mapping – using either an automated thickness mapping tool or even KLA's own sensor wafer techniques. For instance, KLA SensArray wafers can measure temperature uniformity across the wafer during processing; while our case is deposition thickness, any non-uniform temperature could hint at non-uniform deposition. We ensured the optimized runs had uniform conditions. The result: the thickness uniformity remained high – within the acceptable percentage variation across the 200 mm or 300 mm wafer (whichever size we were working with). There were no edge effect anomalies beyond what we saw in the baseline process, meaning our changes didn't cause any new uniformity issues.

Next, we examined the microstructural quality of the films using SEM and XRD. SEM images of the optimized film surfaces and cross-sections were compared with baseline runs. The images showed smooth, continuous films with no increase in roughness or porosity – in fact, in some cases slightly improved smoothness was noted, likely due to the more optimal growth conditions. XRD was used to check if the crystal structure or phase of the material remained as expected (for example, if we're depositing polycrystalline metal or oxide, we want the same phase and preferred orientation as before). The XRD spectra for the optimized process matched the baseline's in terms of peaks, indicating we didn't inadvertently change the material properties while speeding up deposition.

Defect inspection was another validation step. Using particle counters or inspection scans (the kind of tools that detect particles on wafers, which KLA also specializes in), we measured the defectivity of wafers before and after optimization. As mentioned, we found roughly a 20% reduction in defect counts on the optimized process wafers. This could be validated by a simple count on test wafers or through automated inspection routines. We also maintained SPC (Statistical Process Control) charts for key metrics – for instance, we plotted deposition rate run by run, thickness uniformity, and defect counts on control charts. After optimization, these charts showed mean shifts in the positive direction (higher rate, lower defect counts) with tighter control limits (less variability). All points were well within spec limits, indicating a stable improved process.

In summary, the validation confirmed that the optimized process is not a fluke or a solely theoretical improvement – it's empirically proven. We have high confidence that if we deploy this recipe in production, it will consistently yield the faster deposition while meeting all quality requirements. This rigorous validation is especially important in semiconductor manufacturing, where any process change must be vetted thoroughly. By using a combination of dimensional measurements, microscopy, and statistical analysis, we ensured the solution is production-ready and robust.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 11: RELEVANCE TO KLA & CANDIDATE FIT
================================================================================

I want to conclude by explicitly connecting how this project and my skill set make me an excellent fit for the Mechanical Manufacturing Design Engineer role at KLA's SensArray division.

KLA's SensArray products are all about in-situ monitoring and process control – for instance, sensor wafers that measure parameters like temperature or film thickness inside process tools in real time. The work I've done on deposition optimization is directly relevant: I deeply understand how critical in-situ data is for detecting issues and improving processes. In my project, I effectively used sensor data (temperature, etc.) and frequent measurements to guide optimization. At KLA, I would be very comfortable working on systems that require knowledge of the semiconductor fabrication environment and using sensor feedback to enhance process outcomes.

My metrology and process control expertise aligns perfectly with KLA's mission. KLA is known for its metrology and inspection solutions. In this project, I used a variety of metrology techniques to validate results, which parallels how KLA's customers use KLA tools to monitor their processes. I also employed statistical process control methods to ensure stability. This mindset of "if you can't measure it, you can't improve it" is exactly what KLA embodies. I would bring a strong metrology-oriented approach to the role – ensuring that any design or process we work on is quantitatively understood and controlled.

The Bayesian optimization and advanced analytics experience I have is quite cutting-edge in manufacturing. The semiconductor industry is embracing Industry 4.0 concepts, including AI and machine learning for yield improvement. My project is a prime example of applying such techniques in a practical way. I can leverage this knowledge to contribute to KLA's development of next-generation analytics – whether it's improving how sensor data is used to adjust processes on the fly, or helping to create intelligent software that comes with KLA tools to guide customer process optimization. Essentially, I can help KLA remain a leader in applying data science within semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

In the mechanical design realm, since the role is a Mechanical Manufacturing Design Engineer, it's important that I also understand hardware and systems. My internship exposed me to designing deposition setups (like modifying a spin coating system to improve performance) and integrating sensors into those systems. SensArray's products involve engineered wafer-like devices with embedded sensors – a very cross-disciplinary piece of hardware. With my background, I can appreciate the mechanical and thermal design challenges of such sensor wafers and their handling, and contribute to creating robust designs. Moreover, I can interpret the sensor outputs in the context of mechanical and process phenomena – bridging the gap between raw sensor data and actionable engineering decisions.

Communication and teamwork are another aspect: this presentation itself demonstrates my ability to communicate complex technical content in a clear, formal manner. In an organization like KLA, that skill is vital – whether it's documenting designs, presenting results to stakeholders, or collaborating with cross-functional teams (engineering, software, marketing, customer support). I pride myself on being able to work collaboratively and convey ideas between different domains (for example, explaining a machine learning result to a process engineer, or a mechanical constraint to a data scientist). This will help me integrate well into KLA's innovative and multidisciplinary projects.

Ultimately, I am confident I can make immediate contributions at KLA. Given my hands-on experience in semiconductor process optimization and the engineering rigor I've developed, I can jump into projects related to enhancing deposition processes or developing new sensor-driven control strategies. My background straddles both R&D and real manufacturing, which means I can understand customer pain points and also think creatively about solutions – a combination that is ideal for a company like KLA that both innovates and deeply understands industry needs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also have additional data and analysis in backup slides if you'd like to dive deeper into any particular aspect.

Once again, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this project with you, and I'm excited about the possibility of bringing this kind of innovative process optimization mindset to the KLA SensArray team. I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

EXPERIENCE SNAPSHOT - PRESENTATION GUIDE
======================================

PURPOSE:
Demonstrate direct alignment between your background and KLA SensArray role requirements

WHEN TO USE:
‚Ä¢ As backup slide during Q&A about your experience
‚Ä¢ If interviewer asks about specific technical background
‚Ä¢ To reinforce your qualifications during role-fit discussion
‚Ä¢ As supporting material for "Why you're the right candidate"

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

üìä FOUR EXPERIENCE CATEGORIES:

1. THIN-FILM DEPOSITION (Blue - Top Left)

   - Fab21 tool hookups and layout
   - Chamber sealing and leak testing

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (Yellow - Bottom Left)
   - JMP-based DOE at Rayn
   - 8D methodology at TSMC ($120K savings)
   - Failure data analysis for calibration

4. SYSTEM DESIGN & CAD (Red - Bottom Right)
   - SolidWorks and Fusion360 modeling
   - CFD thermal analysis
   - Engineering drawings for vacuum systems

üó£Ô∏è HOW TO PRESENT (2-3 minutes):

OPENING (30 seconds):
"Let me show you how my experience directly aligns with what KLA SensArray needs. I've organized my background into four key areas."

CATEGORY WALKTHROUGH (90 seconds):
"Starting with thin-film deposition - I have hands-on experience with the exact processes KLA's customers use. At Rayn Innovation, I synthesized nano-films and optimized deposition rates using DOE.

For vacuum systems, at TSMC I designed redundancy plans and coordinated tool installations - critical for the fab environment where SensArray operates.

My root cause analysis experience includes both the statistical rigor (JMP, DOE) and the practical problem-solving (8D, FMEA) that KLA values.

Finally, my CAD and thermal analysis skills directly support sensor wafer design and integration."

CLOSING (30 seconds):
"This isn't just related experience - this is direct, hands-on work in the exact technical domains where KLA SensArray operates."

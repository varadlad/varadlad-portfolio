SLIDE 4 - CLEAN RADIAL REQUIREMENTS DIAGRAM
==========================================

DIAGRAM FEATURES:
✅ Single, professional radial cluster design
✅ No overlapping text - all elements clearly spaced
✅ Central hub with main objective
✅ 5 color-coded requirement clusters
✅ Quantified metrics prominently displayed
✅ Detailed descriptions in separate boxes
✅ Clean white background for projection clarity

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
🎯 CENTER: "Deposition Rate Optimization" - main objective
📊 SPOKES: 5 requirements radiating outward
🎨 COLORS: Professional color scheme (blue, green, yellow, red, purple)
📋 METRICS: Specific targets clearly visible
📝 DETAILS: Supporting information in connected boxes

HOW TO PRESENT:

🗣️ OPENING (30 seconds):
"This radial diagram shows our five integrated optimization requirements. Rather than treating these as trade-offs, our approach aims to achieve all goals simultaneously."

🗣️ CLOCKWISE PRESENTATION (2-3 minutes):
1. TOP (Blue): "Higher Throughput - targeting 40% improvement in deposition rate"
2. TOP-RIGHT (Green): "Quality Preservation - maintaining all film specifications"
3. BOTTOM-RIGHT (Yellow): "Process Consistency - reducing variability by 25%"
4. BOTTOM-LEFT (Red): "Cost Efficiency - achieving 15% savings per wafer"
5. TOP-LEFT (Purple): "Operational Constraints - staying within equipment limits"

🗣️ CLOSING (30 seconds):
"The center represents our integrated solution - optimizing deposition rate while satisfying all requirements through systematic methodology."

KEY ADVANTAGES:
✅ Visual clarity - immediate comprehension
✅ Professional appearance - no text overload
✅ Balanced presentation - equal weight to all requirements
✅ Quantified targets - specific and measurable
✅ Technical credibility - systematic approach

TECHNICAL DEPTH READY:
- Why 40% improvement is achievable
- How quality is maintained during optimization
- Statistical basis for variability reduction targets
- Cost calculation methodology
- Equipment constraint definitions

SLIDE 4 VISUAL REQUIREMENTS GUIDE
=================================

DIAGRAM EXPLANATION:

üéØ RADIAL SPOKE DIAGRAM (Primary Option):
- CENTER CIRCLE: "Optimize Deposition Process" - the main objective
- 5 SPOKES: Each represents a key requirement category
- COLOR CODING: Different colors for easy identification
- METRICS: Quantified targets for each requirement
- DESCRIPTIONS: Brief explanations outside each circle

üìä CYCLE DIAGRAM (Alternative Option):
- PENTAGON SHAPE: Shows interconnected requirements
- CENTER HUB: Optimal deposition process
- CONNECTING LINES: Shows how requirements relate to each other
- BALANCED APPROACH: All requirements equally important

HOW TO PRESENT:

üó£Ô∏è OPENING:
"Rather than list requirements as bullet points, this diagram shows our optimization goals visually. The center represents our main objective - optimizing the deposition process. Each spoke represents a critical requirement."

üó£Ô∏è WALK THROUGH EACH SPOKE:
1. "Higher Throughput (blue) - We're targeting 30-40% improvement in deposition rate"
2. "Quality Preservation (green) - Maintaining all film specifications while going faster"  
3. "Process Consistency (yellow) - Reducing variability and defects by 20-25%"
4. "Cost Efficiency (red) - Achieving 15% cost savings per wafer"
5. "Operational Constraints (purple) - Staying within equipment safety limits"

üó£Ô∏è KEY MESSAGE:
"Notice these aren't trade-offs - our goal is to achieve ALL these requirements simultaneously through intelligent optimization, not by sacrificing one for another."

VISUAL ADVANTAGES:
‚úÖ Immediate comprehension - audience sees all requirements at once
‚úÖ Balanced presentation - no hierarchy implied
‚úÖ Quantified targets - specific metrics clearly displayed
‚úÖ Professional appearance - reduces text-heavy slide syndrome
‚úÖ Memorable format - easier to recall than bullet points

TECHNICAL DEPTH READY:
- Be prepared to explain WHY each target is realistic
- Know the relationships between requirements
- Understand which requirements might conflict and how optimization resolves this
- Connect each requirement to semiconductor manufacturing best practices
